# Number of followers and employees from a list of companies on LinkedIn 
This program is used to gather the number of followers and employees from a list of companies using their page on LinkedIn.

The list LinkedIn links of the companies may be in a file called __'companies.txt'__ in the __same__ folder as the program. This program uses the Google Chrome browser to acess the links, take a screenshot from the page, convert the image in a string using the pytesseract and search for the keywords 'followers' and 'employees' on the string generated by the pytesseract.

Your LinkedIn account should be logged in and in english. The internet browser may be in full screen in order to guarantee that the area of the screenshot will contain the information of the number of followers and employees. To use another browser to navigate, it is necessary to change the text written by the __pyautogui.write__ function inside the funcion __get_txt_from_screenshot(link)__. The information gathered will be available on a .xlsx file called __'LinkedIn Report yyyy-mm-dd.xlsx'__

Once the program is based on the screenshot of the page, it may have some funtioning issues if the format of the page is not in its standard. 

The goal of this project was to work with the pyautogui and pytesseract libraries in Python to help to use them in further automatization projects.
